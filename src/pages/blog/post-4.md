You've probably heard of wip or BetaList, especially if you're a founder or maker. You've probably also heard of Marc Köhlbrugge, the founder of both WIP and beta list. We already know Marc's Product story.

Yet, there's something's that We've never got to cover, how did marc actually build Wip and betalist, and what's the story way before his big break? Here's the full story, From start to end.

# Tell us a bit about yourself, and what you do?

I'm Marc Köhlbrugge, and maker of a variety of products most notably WIP ( https://wip.co ), BetaList ( https://betalist.com ), and Startup Jobs ( https://startup.jobs )

# How did you get introduced into the tech world?

I've been fascinated by computers ever since I was kid. I think I first start using a PC when I was around 9 years old. It ran both MS-DOS and Windows 3.11. I was a very curious kid so I explored every little part of the Windows operating system and MS-DOS command line interface.

# What was your frst I get it now in coding

My first time experiencing the thrill of programming was editing a text file that contained the scores for a game I couldn't beat. I figured out I could write "edit highscores.ini" and just write my own name and score. Then when I launched the game my name and score would show up in the highscore list. That was a very exciting feeling.

This later inspired https://highscore.money which is a highscore leaderboard where you pay to get included. Whatever you choose pay, that's your score.

# Where did the idea for WIP.co come from?

I've been working on different variations on WIP for many years. Many years ago (before Slack was a thing) I started a paid chat group for founders, but I couldn't get enough people to participate. A while later me and a group of friends used a

project management tool to share the todos we were working on. That worked for a while, but when the novelty wore off most of us stopped using it. I think I was the last one left haha. I also worked on a few projects very similar in nature to WIP, but I never shipped them.

I got too excited and built all these features, but the truth is that a community product has to start simple. It's okay to think long-term, but in the early days a community needs a very different product then at its later stage. I was building a product for late-stage community, when I didn't have a single user yet.

It wasn't until three years ago that I started a simple Telegram chatgroup for BetaList things really took off. I didn't want it to become yet another distracting chatgroup, so I took all my lessons and ideas from the past years and quickly developed a chatbot to share what people were working on, added a website with profiles, etc. That's how WIP was born.

# You’re really open and out there in the community Knowing people like levelsio, fajar siddiq. What do you say to founders looking to grow their connections?

I don't really look at it this way. I just try to make cool stuff, share it publicly, and help others where I can. If you do enough of that you'll eventually you start meeting people who share similar interests and values. That's how you make genuine connections.

I don't really believe in networking or intentionally working towards meeting certain people. That might work for some, but to me that just seems like a lot of work.

# What did you want to be as a child?

An inventor! I think that's pretty much what I am, so it worked out well :)

# What was your first job, and what was it like?

I never had a normal job. I was fortunate enough to get the opportunity to start two startups right after graduation. Before that, during school, I did some freelance web development.

# How should someone market or get their service/SAAS or Product out there? Twitter, Oragninc Ads?

That really depends on who the product is for. That should be your number one marketing priority: get a very clear picture of who your customer is. Then just ask them where they hang out. How they discovered other products they use, and replicate that.

# What was your first business, what was it?

So as I mentioned before I actually started two startups right after graduation. The first one was a SaaS for creating press releases. I co-founded in partnership with another developer and The Next Web which is headquartered in the Netherlands.

It's still active today at https://pr.co – it's my first and only venture-backed startup I co-founded.

The second startup was a social e-reader app for the iPad. It was a really exciting time as we were in touch with Oprah's book club, and negiotating with Samsung to become the Galaxy Note's default e-reader app. But in the end it proved too difficult a market to innovate in. With publishers still scared of ebooks and Amazon having a near-monopoly we weren't able to execute as we hoped.

# What was the process of building WIP and BetaList? What were some of the mistakes you tackled early on?

The process for my successful products is always the same: start really small. Ship. Iterate based on user feedback.

I still fall in the trap of trying to think too far ahead and guessing what people want. I then end up building features I'd like people to use, but nobody actually asked for or needs.

# *Expensive.chat, is a social experiment you have. I’m sure people wonder! How much have you made from it?*

That was a fun one! It got a lot of press coverage and definitely helped me get my name out there. But financially it didn't really do much. I think it was less than a $1,000 in revenue. Highscore Money ( https://highscore.money ) did a multiple of that with a technically much simpler product. That just goes to show that technical complexity and revenue are not related.

# *What do you say to new makers + founders looking to grow business. A Peice of advice you didnt have, yet you can give?*

Expect to fail. Most ideas don't work out. And that's fine. The lesson here is not to try and figure out the right idea before you start, but to start immediately and assume whatever you're working on won't work out. But if you keep doing that and you keep trying different things, you will eventually find something that works.

This applies on both a macro- and micro-level. On a macro-level it means you should quickly try many product ideas until you find one that gets traction. And on a micro-level it means within that product you should try many different features, marketing strategies, etc and double down on those that work.

Don't get stuck trying one idea. Don't try to make it perfect. Don't plan ahead too much. Keep experimenting quickly.

# *What is one of the biggest mistakes People tend to do?*

They start with a solution in mind. They come up with a product idea and spend many months perfecting it without getting any customer feedback. That's the biggest waste of time I've seen.

# *How did you grow WIP, and get people to pay for it?*

WIP was free in the beginning. I didn't plan on monetizing it or turning it into a business. At some point though members started asking me if they could pay me. They wanted to support me and ensure WIP would continue to be actively developed.

Free services typically fade away as the team gets distracted working on something else that does pay the bills, they make the user the product and start selling ads, or they end up selling to a bigger business that does the same.

Eventually, WIP became so popular that too many new people were joining each week. It's very disruptive to a community when too many new people come in at the same time. So that's why I decided to make the paid membership mandatory for all new members.

Interestingly enough, many people tell me that's one of the things they like about WIP. By having to pay they feel more invested to get the most out of it, plus they know the same is true for other members. That just wouldn't be same if we let in anyone for free.

# *We ask every person, what is their most favorite artist or band?*

That's a tough question. I'm leaning towards Eminem. I really respect his work ethic, creativity, and his courage to be himself.

# *You follow 0 people on twitter, how do you consume twitter content? IS there an account we don’t know of or are you lists?*

I stopped following people, because I noticed I was spending too much time on Twitter without really enjoying it. I now mostly interact with people through @mentions and DMs. I still occasionally use Twitter Lists to browser people's regular tweets, but most of my online interactions happen through Telegram these days.

# \*You have an incredible work ethic, how did it feel? When you Made WIp? \*Thank you. I just really enjoy what I'm doing so it doesn't feel like work.

Building WIP is really exciting. It's probably the most rewarding product I've worked on, because I get to help the people I care about. Plus every day I get to talk to them.

*People building products, what’s urgent, what’s something that people shouldn’t do, and what’s something awful?*

Urgent: ship what you're working on Don't: overthink things Awful: disrespect other people's work

##

## What Advice do you give to people looking to monetize and make money from their communities?

If your goal is to build a profitable business, don't start a community haha. There are much easier ways to make a buck.

That said, building a community is very rewarding and if you have the patience you might be able to make a living or even better. It will just take a while.

I'm not sure there's one way to monetize a community. It really depends on the specifics. Try figuring out features your most active members want and see if you can charge a premium fee for it. I'd also discover if there are any products or services they are already paying for and see if you can partner with them, or sell a (basic) alternative yourself.

#### *Thanks for joining us Marc, We hope you enjoyed the interview!*

I did. Thanks for having me!
